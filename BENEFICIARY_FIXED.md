# ✅ Beneficiary Feature - FINAL FIX

## 🐛 **Issues Fixed**

### **Issue 1: Save Prompt Not Being Sent** ❌
**Problem:** After transfer completed, no "Save Beneficiary?" prompt was sent.

**Root Cause:**  
- Beneficiary check was done twice (once in transfer processing, once in notification)
- When existing beneficiary found, it updated stats but didn't set conversation state
- When no beneficiary found, it set conversation state but notification didn't send prompt

**Fix:**  
- Moved ALL beneficiary logic to `sendTransferSuccessNotification` method
- Now handles BOTH: setting conversation state AND sending WhatsApp prompt
- Transfer processing only updates usage stats for existing beneficiaries

---

### **Issue 2: Beneficiary Lookup Not Working** ❌
**Problem:** When user said "Send 100 naira to Musa Abdulkadir", system asked for account details instead of looking up saved beneficiary.

**Root Cause:**  
AI was extracting:
```json
{
  "accountNumber": null,
  "recipientName": "Musa Abdulkadir"  ← WRONG FIELD!
}
```

System checked: `if (accountNumber && !isAccountNumberValid)` → FALSE (accountNumber was null)

**Fix:**  
Updated AI prompt with **CRITICAL** instructions:
- When user provides ONLY a name (no digits), put the name in `accountNumber` field
- DO NOT use `recipientName` when there's no account number
- Added explicit JSON examples showing correct format

Now AI extracts:
```json
{
  "accountNumber": "Musa Abdulkadir",  ← CORRECT!
  "recipientName": null
}
```

System checks: `if (accountNumber && !isAccountNumberValid)` → TRUE  
→ Searches beneficiaries by name!

## 📝 **Code Changes**

### **1. AI Assistant** (`src/services/aiAssistant.js`)

#### **Updated Prompt** (Lines 211-220)
```
BENEFICIARY NAME LOOKUP RULES (CRITICAL):
- If user says "Send [amount] to [Name]" WITHOUT digits (no account number), PUT THE NAME IN accountNumber field
- The system will search beneficiaries by that name
- DO NOT put name in recipientName if there's no account number - put it in accountNumber instead!
- Examples:
  * "Send 1k to Musa Abdulkadir" → {"accountNumber": "Musa Abdulkadir", "recipientName": null}
  * "Transfer 500 to Sadiq Maikaba" → {"accountNumber": "Sadiq Maikaba", "recipientName": null}
  * "Send 2k to John Doe" → {"accountNumber": "John Doe", "recipientName": null}
- ONLY use recipientName when BOTH name AND account number are provided
```

#### **Updated JSON Examples** (Lines 300-316)
```json
For Transfer Using Saved Beneficiary Name (CRITICAL FORMAT):
{
  "intent": "bank_transfer",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "extractedData": {
    "amount": 1000,
    "accountNumber": "Musa Abdulkadir",
    "bankName": null,
    "recipientName": null
  },
  "response": "Let me check if you have Musa Abdulkadir saved...",
  "suggestedAction": "Search saved beneficiaries"
}

IMPORTANT: When user provides ONLY a name (no digits), put the name in accountNumber field!
Message: "Send 500 to Sadiq Maikaba" → accountNumber: "Sadiq Maikaba" (NOT recipientName!)
```

---

### **2. Bank Transfer Service** (`src/services/bankTransfer.js`)

#### **Simplified Transfer Processing** (Lines 670-693)
```javascript
// Update existing beneficiary usage stats if this recipient is already saved
try {
  const beneficiaryService = require('./beneficiary');
  
  const existingBeneficiary = await beneficiaryService.findBeneficiary(userId, {
    accountNumber: accountValidation.accountNumber,
    bankCode: transferData.bankCode
  });
  
  if (existingBeneficiary) {
    // Update existing beneficiary usage
    await existingBeneficiary.updateUsage(feeCalculation.amount);
    logger.info('Updated existing beneficiary usage', {
      beneficiaryId: existingBeneficiary.id,
      totalTransactions: existingBeneficiary.totalTransactions
    });
  }
} catch (beneficiaryError) {
  // Don't fail transfer if beneficiary check fails
  logger.warn('Failed to check/update beneficiary', { 
    error: beneficiaryError.message,
    userId 
  });
}
```

**What Changed:**  
- ❌ Removed: Setting conversation state here
- ❌ Removed: Prompt sending logic
- ✅ Kept: Update usage stats for existing beneficiaries

---

#### **Enhanced Success Notification** (Lines 813-901)
```javascript
async sendTransferSuccessNotification(user, accountValidation, feeCalculation, reference, bankCode) {
  try {
    const receiptService = require('./receipt');
    const whatsappService = require('./whatsapp');
    
    // Get proper bank name
    const bankName = accountValidation.bankName || 
                   accountValidation.bank || 
                   await this.getBankNameFromCode(bankCode || accountValidation.bankCode) || 
                   'Bank';

    // Send receipt (image or text)
    // ...

    // Check if this is a new beneficiary and ask to save
    const beneficiaryService = require('./beneficiary');
    const existingBeneficiary = await beneficiaryService.findBeneficiary(user.id, {
      accountNumber: accountValidation.accountNumber,
      bankCode: bankCode || accountValidation.bankCode
    });
    
    if (!existingBeneficiary) {
      // Store pending beneficiary data in conversation state
      await user.updateConversationState({
        intent: 'save_beneficiary_prompt',
        awaitingInput: 'save_beneficiary_confirmation',
        context: 'post_transfer',
        pendingBeneficiary: {
          accountNumber: accountValidation.accountNumber,
          bankCode: bankCode || accountValidation.bankCode,
          bankName: accountValidation.bankName || accountValidation.bank || bankName,
          recipientName: accountValidation.accountName,
          amount: feeCalculation.amount
        }
      });
      
      // Ask user if they want to save this beneficiary
      const savePrompt = `💡 *Save Beneficiary?*\n\n` +
                        `Would you like to save *${accountValidation.accountName}* as a beneficiary?\n\n` +
                        `Next time, you can simply say:\n` +
                        `"Send 1k to ${accountValidation.accountName}"\n\n` +
                        `Reply *YES* to save or *NO* to skip.`;
      
      await whatsappService.sendTextMessage(user.whatsappNumber, savePrompt);
      
      logger.info('Sent save beneficiary prompt and stored pending data', {
        userId: user.id,
        recipientName: accountValidation.accountName,
        accountNumber: accountValidation.accountNumber,
        bankCode: bankCode || accountValidation.bankCode
      });
    }
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('Failed to send transfer success notification', { 
      error: error.message, 
      userId: user.id, 
      reference 
    });
    throw error;
  }
}
```

**What Changed:**  
- ✅ Added `bankCode` parameter to method signature
- ✅ Checks for existing beneficiary
- ✅ If NEW recipient: Sets conversation state + Sends prompt
- ✅ If EXISTING recipient: Does nothing (already saved)

---

#### **Updated Method Call** (Line 697)
```javascript
await this.sendTransferSuccessNotification(
  user, 
  accountValidation, 
  feeCalculation, 
  transaction.reference,
  transferData.bankCode  // ← NEW PARAMETER
);
```

## 🎯 **How It Works Now**

### **Scenario 1: Transfer to NEW Recipient**

```
User: "Send 100 to 9072874728 opay"
  ↓
System: Completes transfer successfully ✅
  ↓
System: Sends receipt
  ↓
System: Checks if beneficiary exists → NO
  ↓
System: Sets conversation state (pendingBeneficiary)
  ↓
System: "💡 Would you like to save Musa Abdulkadir as a beneficiary? Reply YES or NO."
  ↓
User: "Yes"
  ↓
System: "✅ Beneficiary Saved! Next time, just say 'Send 1k to Musa Abdulkadir' 😊"
```

---

### **Scenario 2: Transfer to EXISTING Beneficiary (by account)**

```
User: "Send 200 to 9072874728 opay"

### **Scenario 3: Transfer Using SAVED Beneficiary Name**

```
User: "Send 100 naira to Musa Abdulkadir"
  ↓
AI extracts: {"accountNumber": "Musa Abdulkadir", "recipientName": null}
  ↓
System: Detects "Musa Abdulkadir" is not 8-11 digits
  ↓
System: Searches beneficiaries by name "Musa Abdulkadir"
  ↓
Found! accountNumber: 9072874728, bankCode: 100004, bankName: OPAY
  ↓
System: Auto-fills transfer details
  ↓
System: "💰 Transfer ₦100 to Musa Abdulkadir (OPAY - 9072874728)? Reply YES or NO."
  ↓

## 🧪 **Testing**

### **Test 1: New Recipient → Save Prompt**
1. Transfer to a NEW account number you've never sent to before
2. ✅ After transfer completes, you should see: "💡 Would you like to save..."
3. Reply "YES"
4. ✅ Should see: "✅ Beneficiary Saved!"

### **Test 2: Existing Recipient → No Prompt**
1. Transfer to the SAME account number again
2. ✅ After transfer completes, NO save prompt (already saved)

### **Test 3: Beneficiary Name Lookup**
1. Say: "Send 100 naira to [Recipient Name]"
2. ✅ System should find saved beneficiary and auto-fill details
3. ✅ Proceeds with transfer confirmation

### **Test 4: Unknown Beneficiary Name**
1. Say: "Send 100 to Random Person"
2. ✅ System should say: "I couldn't find 'Random Person' in your saved beneficiaries. Please provide the full details..."

---

## ✅ **Summary**

**What Was Fixed:**
1. ✅ Save beneficiary prompt now sent after EVERY new recipient transfer
2. ✅ Beneficiary lookup by name now works (AI extracts name correctly)
3. ✅ No duplicate prompts for existing beneficiaries
4. ✅ Conversation state properly set for YES/NO responses

**What Was Changed:**
1. AI prompt: Explicit instructions to put name in `accountNumber` field
2. Transfer processing: Only updates usage stats
3. Success notification: Handles ALL beneficiary logic (check + prompt + state)

**Deploy this and test all 4 scenarios above!** 🚀

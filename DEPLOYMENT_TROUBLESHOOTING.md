# MiiMii Fintech Platform - Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues in This Update

### 1. Application Startup Failures ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: App failed to start because database connection was required during startup
**Solution**: Modified startup sequence to start server first, then connect to dependencies asynchronously

### 2. Health Check Configuration ‚úÖ FIXED  
**Problem**: Health checks were too strict and failed when dependencies weren't ready
**Solution**: Improved health checks to be more graceful and return 200 even with degraded services

### 3. Docker Health Check Timeout ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: Health check had insufficient time for app startup
**Solution**: Increased startup period from 40s to 60s and timeout from 10s to 15s

### 4. Missing Environment Variables ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: App crashed when critical environment variables were missing
**Solution**: Added fallback mechanisms and graceful degradation for missing config

## üöÄ Application Startup Behavior

The application now follows this improved startup sequence:

1. **Server Starts Immediately** - HTTP server starts on port 3000 right away
2. **Health Checks Pass** - `/healthz` endpoint responds immediately 
3. **Dependencies Initialize Async** - Database and Redis connect in background
4. **Graceful Degradation** - App continues running even if some services fail

## üìã Environment Variables Configuration

### Required for Basic Operation
```bash
PORT=3000                    # Server port (defaults to 3000)
NODE_ENV=production         # Environment mode
```

### Required for Full Functionality
```bash
# Database (at least one method required)
DB_CONNECTION_URL=postgres://user:pass@host:port/dbname
# OR individual parameters:
DB_HOST=your-db-host
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=your-db-name
DB_USER=your-db-user
DB_PASSWORD=your-db-password

# JWT Authentication
APP_SECRET=your-jwt-secret-key

# WhatsApp Integration
BOT_ACCESS_TOKEN=your-whatsapp-token
BOT_PHONE_NUMBER_ID=your-phone-number-id
BOT_BUSINESS_ACCOUNT_ID=your-business-account-id
BOT_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN=your-webhook-token
```

### Optional Services
```bash
# Redis (optional - app works without it)
REDIS_URL=redis://user:pass@host:port

# AI Features (optional)
AI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
AI_MODEL=gpt-4-turbo

# Banking Integration (optional)
BANK_CONSUMER_KEY=your-bellbank-key
BANK_CONSUMER_SECRET=your-bellbank-secret

# Other services...
```

## üîç Health Check Endpoints

### `/healthz` - Simple Health Check
- Returns 200 if server is running
- No dependency checks
- Used by Docker health check
- **Always use this for load balancer health checks**

### `/health` - Comprehensive Health Check  
- Returns detailed service status
- Shows database and Redis connectivity
- Returns 200 even if some services are degraded
- Use for monitoring and diagnostics

## üêõ Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Connection Refused on Port 3000"
**Symptoms**: Cannot connect to application
**Solutions**:
1. Check if PORT environment variable is set correctly
2. Verify container is exposing port 3000
3. Check firewall/security group settings
4. Ensure application started successfully (check logs)

### Issue: "Database Connection Failed"
**Symptoms**: App starts but database features don't work
**Solutions**:
1. Verify DB_CONNECTION_URL is correctly formatted
2. Check database server is accessible from app
3. Validate database credentials
4. Ensure SSL configuration matches your database setup

### Issue: "WhatsApp Features Not Working"
**Symptoms**: App starts but doesn't respond to WhatsApp messages
**Solutions**:
1. Set BOT_ACCESS_TOKEN environment variable
2. Configure webhook URL in Meta Developer Console
3. Verify BOT_PHONE_NUMBER_ID is correct
4. Check webhook verify token matches

### Issue: "Health Check Failing"
**Symptoms**: Container keeps restarting
**Solutions**:
1. Increase health check timeout and start period
2. Use `/healthz` endpoint instead of `/health`
3. Check application logs for startup errors
4. Verify all required environment variables are set

## üìä Monitoring and Diagnostics

### Check Application Status
```bash
# Test basic connectivity
curl http://your-app-url/healthz

# Get detailed health information
curl http://your-app-url/health

# Test main API endpoint
curl http://your-app-url/
```

### View Application Logs
```bash
# In DigitalOcean App Platform
# Go to your app dashboard ‚Üí Runtime Logs

# Look for these log messages:
# ‚úÖ "MiiMii Fintech Platform server started successfully"
# ‚úÖ "Database connection established successfully" 
# ‚ÑπÔ∏è "Redis not configured - running without Redis features"
# ‚ö†Ô∏è "Database connection failed - continuing without database features"
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è DigitalOcean Specific Configuration

### App Platform Settings
- **Instance Size**: Minimum `apps-s-1vcpu-0.5gb` recommended
- **Health Check**: Use `/healthz` endpoint
- **Port**: Ensure HTTP port is set to 3000
- **Start Period**: Minimum 60 seconds recommended

### Environment Variables in DO Console
1. Go to your app in DigitalOcean dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
3. Add variables using the format from this guide
4. Deploy changes

## üîß Quick Fixes

### If App Won't Start At All
1. Check that `PORT=3000` is set
2. Verify Docker image builds successfully
3. Check startup command is `npm start`
4. Review runtime logs for specific errors

### If App Starts But Features Don't Work
1. Add missing environment variables one by one
2. Check `/health` endpoint to see which services are down
3. Start with database configuration first
4. Add other integrations after basic app is working

### If Health Checks Keep Failing
1. Change health check URL to `/healthz`
2. Increase timeout to 15+ seconds
3. Increase start period to 60+ seconds
4. Test endpoint manually first

## üìû Support

If issues persist after following this guide:
1. Check application logs in DigitalOcean dashboard
2. Test endpoints manually using curl
3. Verify environment variables are set correctly
4. Review the `/health` endpoint response for detailed status

The application is now designed to be much more resilient and should start successfully even with minimal configuration!

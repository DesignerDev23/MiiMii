# Bilal 403 Error Analysis

## 🔍 Problem: Intermittent 403 Errors

Looking at the logs, we have:

### ✅ **Working Request (User: 81f5d178... at 23:22:40)**
```
Amount: ₦100
Phone: 07035437910
Network: MTN
Result: SUCCESS ✅
Response: "successfully purchase MTN VTU to 07035437910"
Bilal Balance: ₦4,852.50 → ₦4,755.00
```

### ❌ **Failing Request (User: ee4442e9... at 23:30:51)**
```
Amount: ₦500
Phone: 07072431546
Network: MTN
Result: 403 FORBIDDEN ❌
Error: Request failed with status code 403
```

---

## 💡 Key Observation

**Both requests use identical:**
- ✅ Same URL: `https://legitdataway.com/api/topup`
- ✅ Same authentication: `Token d3fc009dcefe03...`
- ✅ Same payload structure
- ✅ Same headers

**But one succeeds, one fails!**

## 🔍 Possible Causes

### 1. **Bilal Account Balance Issue**
From earlier data purchase logs:
```
"errorResponse": {
  "status": "fail",
  "message": "Insufficient Account Kindly Fund Your Wallet => ₦144.66"
}
```

**Theory:** After the ₦100 airtime purchase succeeded, the Bilal wallet may have insufficient funds for the ₦500 airtime purchase.

**Check:**
- First purchase (₦100): Success when balance was ₦4,852.50
- Second purchase (₦500): Failed when balance might be ₦4,755.00
- If data purchase cost was already deducted, balance might be too low

### 2. **Rate Limiting**
The second request came **8 minutes later** (23:22 vs 23:30).

Bilal API might have:
- Request rate limits per time period
- Temporary blocks after certain transaction volumes
- Cool-down periods between requests

### 3. **Phone Number Validation**
Both requests use the same phone number `07072431546`, but:
- First time: Success
- Second time: Blocked (possible duplicate transaction prevention)

### 4. **Request-ID Collision**
While request IDs are unique (`Airtime_1759447360657` vs `Airtime_1759447851455`), Bilal might have:
- Duplicate transaction detection
- Same phone + same amount within time window = blocked

## 🎯 Recommended Solution

### Immediate Fix: Better Error Handling

We need to capture the actual error response from Bilal (not just 403), so we can tell users the real reason.

Currently, we only see:
```
"Request failed with status code 403"
```

But we need to see:
```
{
  "status": "fail",
  "message": "Insufficient Account Kindly Fund Your Wallet",
  OR
  "message": "Duplicate transaction detected",
  OR
  "message": "Rate limit exceeded"
}
```

## 💻 Code Fix Needed

Update the Bilal error handling to log the actual API response body, not just the status code.

---

## ✅ Action Items

1. **Enhanced Error Logging** - Capture full Bilal error response
2. **Check Bilal Balance** - View your Legit Data Way dashboard balance
3. **Test with Different Amount** - Try ₦100 instead of ₦500
4. **Wait Between Requests** - Add 30-second delay if needed
5. **Contact Bilal Support** - Ask about rate limits and duplicate detection

Would you like me to add better error logging to capture the actual Bilal API error message?

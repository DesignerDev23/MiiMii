# ✅ Beneficiary Feature - Complete Redesign

## 🎯 **NEW FLOW (As Requested)**

### **Step 1: Complete the Transfer First**
User sends money → Transfer completes successfully → Receipt sent ✅

### **Step 2: Ask to Save Beneficiary**
```
💡 *Save Beneficiary?*

Would you like to save *Musa Abdulkadir* as a beneficiary?

Next time, you can simply say:
"Send 1k to Musa Abdulkadir"

Reply *YES* to save or *NO* to skip.
```

### **Step 3: User Responds**
- **User says YES** → System saves beneficiary with recipient's actual name
- **User says NO** → System skips, beneficiary not saved

### **Step 4: Future Transfers**
```
User: "Send 1k to Musa Abdulkadir"
  ↓
System searches beneficiaries by name "Musa Abdulkadir"
  ↓
Finds: accountNumber, bankCode, bankName
  ↓
Auto-fills transfer details
  ↓
Proceeds with transfer! ✅
```

## 📝 **What Changed**

### **1. Bank Transfer Service** (`src/services/bankTransfer.js`)

#### **After Successful Transfer** (Lines 670-714)
```javascript
// Check if recipient is already a beneficiary
const existingBeneficiary = await beneficiaryService.findBeneficiary(userId, {
  accountNumber: accountValidation.accountNumber,
  bankCode: transferData.bankCode
});

if (!existingBeneficiary) {
  // Store pending beneficiary data in conversation state
  await user.updateConversationState({
    intent: 'save_beneficiary_prompt',
    awaitingInput: 'save_beneficiary_confirmation',
    context: 'post_transfer',
    pendingBeneficiary: {
      accountNumber: accountValidation.accountNumber,
      bankCode: transferData.bankCode,
      bankName: accountValidation.bank,
      recipientName: accountValidation.accountName,
      amount: feeCalculation.amount
    }
  });
}
```

#### **In Success Notification** (Lines 885-906)
```javascript
// Ask user if they want to save this beneficiary
const savePrompt = `💡 *Save Beneficiary?*\n\n` +
                  `Would you like to save *${accountValidation.accountName}* as a beneficiary?\n\n` +
                  `Next time, you can simply say:\n` +
                  `"Send 1k to ${accountValidation.accountName}"\n\n` +
                  `Reply *YES* to save or *NO* to skip.`;

await whatsappService.sendTextMessage(user.whatsappNumber, savePrompt);
```

---

### **2. Message Processor** (`src/services/messageProcessor.js`)

#### **Handle YES/NO Response** (Lines 1033-1082)
```javascript
if (state.awaitingInput === 'save_beneficiary_confirmation' && state.pendingBeneficiary) {
  const lower = messageContent.toLowerCase().trim();
  
  if (/(^|\b)(yes|y|yeah|yep|sure|ok|okay)(\b|$)/.test(lower)) {
    const beneficiary = await beneficiaryService.autoSaveBeneficiary(user.id, {
      accountNumber: pendingBeneficiary.accountNumber,
      bankCode: pendingBeneficiary.bankCode,
      bankName: pendingBeneficiary.bankName,
      recipientName: pendingBeneficiary.recipientName,
      amount: pendingBeneficiary.amount
    }, null);
    
    await whatsappService.sendTextMessage(
      user.whatsappNumber,
      `✅ *Beneficiary Saved!*\n\n` +
      `I've saved *${pendingBeneficiary.recipientName}* to your beneficiaries.\n\n` +
      `Next time, just say:\n` +
      `"Send 1k to ${pendingBeneficiary.recipientName}" 😊`
    );
  }
  
  if (/(^|\b)(no|n|nope|cancel)(\b|$)/.test(lower)) {
    await whatsappService.sendTextMessage(user.whatsappNumber, 
      '👍 No problem! You can always save beneficiaries later.');
  }
  
  await user.clearConversationState();
}
```

---

### **3. AI Assistant** (`src/services/aiAssistant.js`)

#### **Beneficiary Name Lookup** (Lines 955-1007)
```javascript
// If accountNumber is not valid digits, it might be a beneficiary name
if (accountNumber && !isAccountNumberValid) {
  const beneficiaryService = require('./beneficiary');
  
  // Search beneficiaries by name
  const beneficiary = await beneficiaryService.searchBeneficiaries(user.id, accountNumber);
  
  if (beneficiary && beneficiary.length > 0) {
    const match = beneficiary[0]; // Use first/best match
    
    // Use saved beneficiary details
    extractedData.accountNumber = match.accountNumber;
    extractedData.bankCode = match.bankCode;
    extractedData.bankName = match.bankName;
    extractedData.recipientName = match.name;
    extractedData.beneficiaryId = match.id;
  } else {
    return {
      intent: 'bank_transfer',
      message: `I couldn't find "${accountNumber}" in your saved beneficiaries.\n\n` +
               `Please provide the full details:\n\n` +
               `📝 Example: 'Send 10k to ${accountNumber} 9072874728 Opay'`
    };
  }
}
```

#### **Updated AI Prompt** (Lines 211-219)
```
BENEFICIARY NAME LOOKUP RULES:
- If user says "Send [amount] to [Name]" without account number, search beneficiaries by that name
- Match against saved beneficiary names (recipient names from previous transfers)
- Examples:
  * "Send 1k to Musa Abdulkadir" → Search beneficiaries for "Musa Abdulkadir"
  * "Transfer 500 to Sadiq Maikaba" → Search beneficiaries for "Sadiq Maikaba"
- If found, use saved account details (accountNumber, bankCode, bankName)
- If not found, ask user to provide full details
```

## 🎬 **Complete User Journey**

### **Scenario 1: First Transfer to New Recipient**

```
User: "Send 500 to 9072874728 opay"
  ↓
System: Verifies account → Sends transfer → ✅ Success!
  ↓
System: Sends receipt
  ↓
System: "💡 Would you like to save Musa Abdulkadir as a beneficiary?"
  ↓
User: "Yes"
  ↓
System: "✅ Beneficiary Saved! Next time, just say 'Send 1k to Musa Abdulkadir' 😊"
```

---

### **Scenario 2: Transfer to Saved Beneficiary**

```
User: "Send 1k to Musa Abdulkadir"
  ↓
System: Searches beneficiaries for "Musa Abdulkadir"
  ↓
Found! Account: 9072874728, Bank: Opay
  ↓
System: Auto-fills details → Confirms transfer → Sends PIN flow
  ↓
User: Enters PIN
  ↓
System: ✅ Transfer successful to Musa Abdulkadir!
  ↓
System: NO prompt (already saved as beneficiary)
```

---

### **Scenario 3: User Declines to Save**

```
User: "Send 2k to 1234567890 GTBank"
  ↓
System: Transfer successful!
  ↓
System: "💡 Would you like to save John Doe as a beneficiary?"
  ↓
User: "No"
  ↓
System: "👍 No problem! You can always save beneficiaries later."
```

## 🚫 **What Was REMOVED**

### ❌ Removed: Nickname-based Extraction
```javascript
// OLD (REMOVED)
beneficiaryNickname: "my opay"
beneficiaryNickname: "mom"
beneficiaryNickname: "sister"
```

**Why?** You specifically requested:
> "if the user wants to transfer to that person again will only said 'send 1k to Musa Abdulkadir' then it will capture his bank details from his beneficiaries"

Use **actual recipient names**, not nicknames!

---

### ❌ Removed: Auto-save During Transfer
```javascript
// OLD (REMOVED)
const savedBeneficiary = await beneficiaryService.autoSaveBeneficiary(userId, {
  accountNumber: accountValidation.accountNumber,
  // ... saved immediately during transfer
}, transferData.beneficiaryNickname);
```

**Why?** You specifically requested:
> "this beneficiary stuff should be after the transfer was successful then the system will first check if the recipient is not from the user's beneficiaries, then will ask the user do want to save"

Now it **asks first**, doesn't auto-save!

---

## 🔧 **Key Technical Details**

### **Beneficiary Search Logic**
- Uses `searchBeneficiaries(userId, searchTerm)` from `beneficiaryService`
- Searches by: `name`, `nickname`, `accountNumber`, `phoneNumber`
- Case-insensitive (uses `Op.iLike`)
- Returns results sorted by: `isFavorite DESC`, `totalTransactions DESC`

### **Conversation State Management**
```javascript
conversationState: {
  intent: 'save_beneficiary_prompt',
  awaitingInput: 'save_beneficiary_confirmation',
  context: 'post_transfer',
  pendingBeneficiary: {
    accountNumber: "9072874728",
    bankCode: "100004",
    bankName: "OPAY (PAYCOM)",
    recipientName: "Musa Abdulkadir",
    amount: 500
  }
}
```

### **Regex Patterns for YES/NO**
```javascript
YES: /(^|\b)(yes|y|yeah|yep|sure|ok|okay)(\b|$)/
NO:  /(^|\b)(no|n|nope|cancel)(\b|$)/
```

## ✅ **Testing Checklist**

- [ ] Transfer to new recipient → Receive save prompt
- [ ] Reply "YES" → Beneficiary saved successfully
- [ ] Reply "NO" → Beneficiary not saved, conversation cleared
- [ ] Transfer to saved beneficiary by name → Auto-fills details
- [ ] Transfer to non-existent beneficiary name → Asks for full details
- [ ] Transfer to existing beneficiary → No save prompt (already saved)

---

## 🎉 **Final Result**

✅ Transfer completes first  
✅ User is ASKED if they want to save  
✅ User says YES to save beneficiary  
✅ Future transfers use recipient's ACTUAL NAME (not nickname)  
✅ System searches by name and auto-fills account details  

**Exactly as you requested!** 🚀

# Bank Transfer Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The system was responding "I couldn't identify the bank 'keystone'" when users tried to make bank transfers to Keystone Bank. This was happening because:

1. **Limited Static Bank Mapping**: The AI assistant service had a limited static bank mapping that only included `'keystone': '082'` (3-digit code) instead of the required 6-digit institution code `'000082'`.

2. **Inconsistent Bank Name Recognition**: Different parts of the system had different bank mapping implementations, leading to inconsistent recognition.

3. **Missing Bank Name Variations**: The system didn't properly handle variations like "keystone bank" vs "keystone".

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Updated AI Assistant Service (`src/services/aiAssistant.js`)

**Enhanced `handleBankTransfer` method:**
- **Dynamic Bank Mapping**: Now attempts to fetch bank mappings from BellBank API first (`https://baas-api.bellmfb.com/v1/transfer/banks`)
- **Comprehensive Fallback**: Added comprehensive static bank mapping with 6-digit institution codes
- **Flexible Matching**: Improved bank name matching to handle variations and partial matches

**Added `getStaticBankCodeMapping()` method:**
- Comprehensive mapping of 3-digit bank codes to 6-digit institution codes
- Includes traditional banks, digital banks, and fintech companies
- Proper mapping for Keystone Bank: `'keystone': '000082'` and `'keystone bank': '000082'`

**Updated System Prompt:**
- Enhanced bank name recognition patterns
- Added more bank name variations including "keystone bank", "keystone"
- Improved AI training for better bank name extraction

### 2. Updated Message Processor (`src/services/messageProcessor.js`)

**Enhanced `handleTransferIntent` method:**
- **Dynamic Bank Mapping**: Now uses BellBank API for dynamic bank mapping
- **Comprehensive Fallback**: Updated static mapping to include all bank variations
- **Better Error Messages**: Updated error messages to include "Keystone" as an example

**Improved Bank Name Recognition:**
- Added comprehensive bank name variations
- Better handling of partial matches
- Consistent mapping across all bank types

### 3. Bank Mapping Strategy

**Primary Strategy (Dynamic):**
1. Fetch bank list from BellBank API: `https://baas-api.bellmfb.com/v1/transfer/banks`
2. Create mapping from bank names to institution codes
3. Handle bank name variations and abbreviations
4. Cache results for 1 hour to improve performance

**Fallback Strategy (Static):**
1. Comprehensive static mapping with 6-digit institution codes
2. Multiple variations for each bank name
3. Handles both traditional and digital banks

### 4. Key Bank Mappings Added/Updated

**Traditional Banks:**
- `'keystone': '000082'` and `'keystone bank': '000082'`
- `'gtb': '000058'` and `'gtbank': '000058'`
- `'access': '000014'` and `'access bank': '000014'`
- And many more with full variations

**Digital Banks:**
- `'opay': '000090'`, `'palmpay': '000091'`, `'kuda': '000092'`
- `'moniepoint': '000104'`, `'providus': '000106'`
- And comprehensive coverage of all major digital banks

## Testing

Created `test_bank_recognition.js` to verify:
1. Dynamic bank mapping from BellBank API
2. Static fallback mapping
3. AI intent analysis simulation
4. Bank name extraction from user messages

## Expected Results

After these fixes:
1. ✅ "keystone" and "keystone bank" will be properly recognized
2. ✅ System will use 6-digit institution codes (000082) instead of 3-digit codes (082)
3. ✅ Dynamic bank mapping will provide up-to-date bank information
4. ✅ Fallback mechanisms ensure reliability even if API is unavailable
5. ✅ Consistent bank recognition across all system components

## API Integration

The system now properly integrates with:
- **Bank List API**: `https://baas-api.bellmfb.com/v1/transfer/banks`
- **Name Enquiry API**: `https://docs.bellmfb.com/references/bank-transfer/name-enquiry`
- **Transfer API**: For processing actual transfers

## Monitoring

The system includes comprehensive logging to monitor:
- Dynamic bank mapping success/failure
- Fallback usage patterns
- Bank recognition accuracy
- API response times and errors

This ensures the system can be monitored and improved over time.
